Simple YT Ad Blocker - Extension Description for Mozilla Add-ons
What it does:

Simple YT Ad Blocker automatically skips YouTube ads, allowing uninterrupted video playback. It detects ads and either skips them immediately or fast-forwards to the end. The extension works in the background without requiring user interaction.
How it works:

- Uses a MutationObserver to detect ad elements in real-time.
- Identifies and skips pre-roll and mid-roll ads by adjusting the video playback time.
- Clicks the "Skip Ad" button when available.
- Hides unnecessary ad overlays for a cleaner viewing experience.
- Runs in the background for seamless ad-skipping.

What it does NOT do:

- Does not block YouTube ads before they load (it only skips them).
- Does not remove sponsored content within videos.
- Does not interfere with YouTube’s UI or cause playback issues.
- Does not collect any data.

No configuration needed – just install and enjoy ad-free YouTube!
